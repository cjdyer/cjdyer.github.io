                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    Over the course of more than 8 years competing in robotics, I have honed a diverse set of skills
                    that significantly contributed to my success as a graduate software engineer. One crucial aspect was
                    working extensively in teams of varying sizes, experience levels, and backgrounds, which sharpened
                    my ability to adapt and communicate effectively with colleagues in professional settings. The
                    collaborative nature of robotics competitions laid a strong foundation for my teamwork skills and
                    fostered a holistic approach to problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    My journey in robotics exposed me to the intricacies of software, hardware design, and system
                    integration. Through this exposure, I became proficient in the C/C++ programming language, gained
                    expertise in API software usage and creation, and embraced best practices in documentation and
                    version control. Furthermore, the hands-on experience with mechanical principles through continuous
                    design iterations and building processes offered me a unique perspective that enables me to better
                    collaborate with hardware teams in my software engineering career.

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    The high-pressure, high-speed environments of robotics competitions instilled in me a strong sense
                    of dedication and determination, qualities that continue to drive my excellence in professional
                    settings. When confronted with complex challenges in my career, I draw upon the resilience developed
                    during my robotics journey, always seeking the best way forward. Additionally, my experience in
                    volunteer work with STEAM-ED and local schools polished my ability to convey technical ideas
                    clearly, a skill well utilised in the engineering field. The profound impact of my robotics
                    background has equipped me with a competitive edge and nurtured my growth into a driven and capable
                    professional in the world of software engineering.

                                In 2021, as part of my degree, teams were presented with the problem of creating an
                                autonomous robot to navigate a room. My team developed our solution in three parts: high
                                level control of the robot and its path, direct control of the hardware and robot
                                position, and a user interface where we could see the status of the robot and give
                                instructions. High level control of the robot was achieved using a Raspberry Pi,
                                programmed with a custom Real Time Operating System to receive data from a LiDAR and
                                user input over Wi-Fi to inform its overall path. Direct control was done via a Nucleo
                                f303k8 board, which was programmed using a custom pure pursuit algorithm and
                                encoder/gyroscope odometry. The motherboard (Raspberry Pi), was in constant
                                communication with the daughter board to give movement instructions and verify local
                                position data with the global position. This project improved my coding skills in
                                Assembly and C/C++, and gave me experience creating a user interface in C# for Windows
                                and Android.

                                In 2020, as part of my degree, teams were tasked with creating a coil winding system
                                from scratch. My team decided to create an open bed model, to allow quick and easy
                                prototyping or component replacement. This project required me to create a coil winding
                                and serial communication program in C++ for use on a STM32 FR446RE microcontroller. By
                                using stepper motors and a tensioning system, we were able to implement a simple
                                velocity PID to maintain the speed between the input and output coils. This allowed for
                                accurate winding and improved system reliability. In addition, I created a windows
                                application using C# for the user to interface with, focusing on an intuitive and easy
                                layout. The user settings would then be sent via UART serial to the microcontroller and
                                applied.

                                In the summer of 2020, I had the opportunity to work at Zespri, where my main task
                                involved developing a kiwifruit recognition system. Initially, we explored the potential
                                of using artificial intelligence. However, it became evident early on that this approach
                                worked well only in ideal lighting conditions, failing to perform adequately under
                                low-light situations. To overcome this challenge, I implemented a colour analysis
                                algorithm with an object permanence map, which significantly improved the results in all
                                trial runs. Building on this success, I proceeded to develop C++ code that transformed
                                Time-of-Flight camera data into a 3D model. This 3D model was further analysed using a
                                custom plugin for Blender, allowing for precise edge detection. To ensure seamless
                                integration, the 3D model data was then matched and combined with the regular camera
                                data. Finally, to provide a user-friendly interface, I created a C# application to
                                present the processed information to the end-users. This application allowed them to
                                interact with and utilise the kiwifruit recognition system effectively.

                                In my time competing I was able to make it to the World Championships in America for
                                three consecutive years, after winning the National Championships in New Zealand against
                                70+ teams. At the World's level, we were division quarter finalists in 2018 and received
                                the Worlds Community award in 2019 for our STEM outreach efforts. At the national level,
                                in 2018 we were tournament champions and received the Design Notebook award for best
                                design process and documentation. The following year, we were tournament finalists and
                                received the Excellence Award for the best overall team ranking, robot program, build
                                quality, and design. This is the highest award possible in the competition.

                                As VEX is a highschool program, once I graduated college I put my full effort into
                                mentoring teams and promoting robotics. During the university year I mentored teams in
                                Palmerston North, most notably, Palmerston North Girls' High School and St. Peters. To
                                promote robotics in the region, I assisted in running events, helped teams and most
                                importantly talked to local parents and teachers in attendance. This mentoring also
                                extended to teams in the Bay of Plenty region when home from university.
