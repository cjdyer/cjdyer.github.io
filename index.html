                            I am an extremely driven and creative individual. Currently, I am seeking a software
                            engineering position to complement my Mechatronics degree from Massey University and
                            leverage my work experience as a Software Engineer in the fields of Robotics and Automation.
                            Through practical application, I have developed a deep understanding of the engineering
                            process and gained valuable experience in robotics. This journey has honed my proficiency in
                            multiple coding languages, CAD software, and report writing, and has also included working
                            in a full-stack development environment, building and maintaining both frontend and backend
                            systems.

                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    Over more than eight years of competing in robotics, I developed a diverse set of skills that laid
                    a strong foundation for my success as a software engineer. Working closely in teams of varying
                    sizes, skill levels, and disciplines sharpened my ability to adapt, collaborate, and communicate
                    effectively in technical environments. These experiences cultivated a holistic, team-oriented
                    approach to problem-solving that continues to serve me well in professional contexts.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    Robotics exposed me to the complexities of both software and hardware integration, where I gained
                    hands-on experience in C/C++, API design, version control, and technical documentation. Iterative
                    design and build cycles deepened my understanding of mechanical systems and gave me valuable insight
                    into cross-disciplinary collaboration—particularly between hardware and software teams. This early
                    exposure helped me build confidence working across technical stacks and communicating clearly about
                    complex systems.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-right">
                    Since transitioning into industry, I've spent the past four years working as a full-stack software
                    engineer as well as a software engineer in the fields of robotics and automation. I've contributed to
                    both backend and frontend systems, developed production-grade software, and worked closely with
                    cross-functional teams to deliver integrated solutions. My foundation in robotics has evolved into a
                    pragmatic, real-world skill set—combining low-level systems knowledge with modern software development
                    practices to solve challenging engineering problems with impact and efficiency.

                                In my time competing I was able to make it to the World Championships in America for
                                three consecutive years, after winning the National Championships in New Zealand against
                                70+ teams. At the World's level, we were division quarter finalists in 2018 and received
                                the Worlds Community award in 2019 for our STEM outreach efforts. At the national level,
                                in 2018 we were tournament champions and received the Design Notebook award for best
                                design process and documentation. The following year, we were tournament finalists and
                                received the Excellence Award for the best overall team ranking, robot program, build
                                quality, and design. This is the highest award possible in the competition.

                                As VEX is a highschool program, once I graduated college I put my full effort into
                                mentoring teams and promoting robotics. During the university year I mentored teams in
                                Palmerston North, most notably, Palmerston North Girls' High School and St. Peters. To
                                promote robotics in the region, I assisted in running events, helped teams and most
                                importantly talked to local parents and teachers in attendance. This mentoring also
                                extended to teams in the Bay of Plenty region when home from university.

                                In 2021, as part of my degree, teams were presented with the problem of creating an
                                autonomous robot to navigate a room. My team developed our solution in three parts: high
                                level control of the robot and its path, direct control of the hardware and robot
                                position, and a user interface where we could see the status of the robot and give
                                instructions. High level control of the robot was achieved using a Raspberry Pi,
                                programmed with a custom Real Time Operating System to receive data from a LiDAR and
                                user input over Wi-Fi to inform its overall path. Direct control was done via a Nucleo
                                f303k8 board, which was programmed using a custom pure pursuit algorithm and
                                encoder/gyroscope odometry. The motherboard (Raspberry Pi), was in constant
                                communication with the daughter board to give movement instructions and verify local
                                position data with the global position. This project improved my coding skills in
                                Assembly and C/C++, and gave me experience creating a user interface in C# for Windows
                                and Android.

                                In the summer of 2020, I had the opportunity to work at Zespri, where my main task
                                involved developing a kiwifruit recognition system. Initially, we explored the potential
                                of using artificial intelligence. However, it became evident early on that this approach
                                worked well only in ideal lighting conditions, failing to perform adequately under
                                low-light situations. To overcome this challenge, I implemented a colour analysis
                                algorithm with an object permanence map, which significantly improved the results in all
                                trial runs. Building on this success, I proceeded to develop C++ code that transformed
                                Time-of-Flight camera data into a 3D model. This 3D model was further analysed using a
                                custom plugin for Blender, allowing for precise edge detection. To ensure seamless
                                integration, the 3D model data was then matched and combined with the regular camera
                                data. Finally, to provide a user-friendly interface, I created a C# application to
                                present the processed information to the end-users. This application allowed them to
                                interact with and utilise the kiwifruit recognition system effectively.

                                In 2020, as part of my degree, teams were tasked with creating a coil winding system
                                from scratch. My team decided to create an open bed model, to allow quick and easy
                                prototyping or component replacement. This project required me to create a coil winding
                                and serial communication program in C++ for use on a STM32 FR446RE microcontroller. By
                                using stepper motors and a tensioning system, we were able to implement a simple
                                velocity PID to maintain the speed between the input and output coils. This allowed for
                                accurate winding and improved system reliability. In addition, I created a windows
                                application using C# for the user to interface with, focusing on an intuitive and easy
                                layout. The user settings would then be sent via UART serial to the microcontroller and
                                applied.
